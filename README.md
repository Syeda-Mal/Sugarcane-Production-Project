# Sugarcane Production Analysis Project

# Overview
This project delves into the comprehensive analysis of sugarcane production across various countries. The dataset provides insights into production quantity, production per person, acreage, and yield.

## Purpose
This analysis has been done to answer arising questions when we think about sugarcane production across various countries. Some example questions include:
- Which continent has the highest number countries producing sugarcane?
- Which country has the highest production of sugarcane?
- Which country has the most land & whether most amount of land translates to highest production of sugarcane or not?
- Do number of countries in a Continent effects production of sugarcane?
  And so on...

# Dataset (Columns)
1. Country: Country name
2. Continent: Continent of the country
3. Production(Tons): Total sugarcane production in tons
4. Production_per_Person(Kg): Sugarcane production per person in kilograms
5. Acreage(Hectare): Total acreage dedicated to sugarcane cultivation in hectares
6. Yield(Kg/Hectare): Yield of sugarcane in kilograms per hectare

## Data Cleaning
The dataset underwent a cleaning process to ensure accuracy and consistency:
-> Removed dots and replaced commas for better numerical representation
-> Converted data types to appropriate formats
-> Handled missing values by dropping relevant entries

## Exploratory Data Analysis
### Univariate Analysis
Explored individual columns to understand their distribution and characteristics.

### Bivariate Analysis
Investigated relationships between different variables, including production, acreage, and yield.

### Correlation
Explored the correlation matrix to identify relationships between different features.

### Analysis by Continent
Analyzed sugarcane production based on continents, examining factors such as the number of countries, production distribution, and correlation.

## Conclusion
Concluded with key findings and insights derived from the analysis, emphasizing factors influencing sugarcane production.
